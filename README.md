React UI components created based on [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate).

### Getting Started
1. Clone or fork this repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start`

### Use it for something else?
`npm run clean` should give you back the blank boilerplate. Then make changes to the packages.json as necessary
